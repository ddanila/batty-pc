# Known bugs (user-reported, unfixed)

Concrete defects observed by the user that aren't yet caught by the
visual-regression test (= mid-game state we don't snapshot). Listed
here so the next iter has a target. When fixing, add a section to
`per-level-profile.md` or the relevant area doc; remove from here.

(none currently — the `replay-l3-entry` "0 → 1885 px" entry was resolved
2026-06-11: the SCREEN had already healed back to 0/23040 px by the time
it was re-triaged, and the residual FAIL was the gate comparing
moment-dependent probe rows across different instants — the original
probed at the `$BA83` pause vs the port's PROBE.TXT rewritten by its ESC
handler at harness teardown. The "original=8E49" RNG reading was an echo
of the setup pin at the WRONG address `$8E17` (real `random_number` is
`$8D48` = 3793). Gate semantics fixed + green; full story in
`notes/replay-harness.md`, "Gate semantics corrected".)
